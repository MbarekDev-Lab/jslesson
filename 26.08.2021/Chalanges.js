    1. Check if two given integer values are in the range 50 to 99 (this includes both 50 and 99). Print true if either of them are in the range.

    2. Check if three given integer values are in the range 50 to 99 (inclusive). Print true if one or more of them are in the range.

    3. Declare the variables a, b and c, and give them number values. Check which one out of the three variables has the largest value and print it to the console. Then change the values of the variables to see if your conditional still works.

    4. Create a new string adding "Py" in front of a given string. If the given string begins with "Py" then print the original string.
        (i.e.  HTML  --> PyHTML   ,  Python  -->  Python)

    5. Calculate the sum of the two integers. If the sum is in the range 50 to 80, print 65, otherwise print 80.

    6. Check whether the sum of two integers is 8, or whether their difference is 8. If one of these is the case, print true, otherwise print false.

    7. Check whether either one of two integers is 15, or if their sum is 15. If one of these is the case, print true, otherwise print false.

    8. Check whether one of two integers is a multiple of 7 or 11. If so, print true.

    9. Calculate the sum of the two given integers. If the two values are the same, then print triple their sum.

    10. Calculate the difference between a specified number and 19. Print double the difference if the specified number is greater than 19.

    BONUS CHALLENGE: Make a variable for firstName and age and give each variable values. Create an if/else statement to check whether the person's age is less than 13. If so, print "firstName is a child". If the age is equal to or more than 13 and less than 20, print "firstName is a teenager". If the person's age is equal to or more than 20 and less than 30, then print "firstName is a young adult". If none of these conditions apply, print "firstName is a adult".

    Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. 
    In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. 
    If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

    1.  Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. 
        It's not allowed to use an if/else statement ðŸ˜… (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
    2.  Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). 
        Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'

    
    TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

    HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
    HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 ðŸ˜‰

    GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

    1. Color Analyzer
        Create a switch statement that prints a different statement for each color possibility (red, blue, green, yellow).

    2. Grading
        Create a switch statement that prints different comments depending on a grade.

    3. Fruits
        Create a switch statement that prints different statement for various fruit (e.g. banana, orange, strawberry, apple).

    4. Percentage Complete.
        If percentageComplete is below 30, print "Still a long way to go".
        If the percentageComplete is between 30 and 50, print "Slowly getting there".
        If percentageComplete is between 51 and 80, print "You can do it!".
        If percentageComplete is between 81 and 99, print "This is the last push!".
        If percentageComplete is 100, print "You're there. Well done!".
    
    5. Differences
        When should you use a switch statement versus an if else statement. Comment your answer in your js file.
